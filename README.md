RViz plugin for initializing Hubo hardware

Finally, a graphical user interface for running the Hubo hardware on Linux! :D

As was decided at the Drexel meeting in February, GUIs for operating Hubo on Linux
are going to be ROS-based (specifically using RViz). This is the first step in making
that integration a reality.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
_______________________________  IF  YOU  ARE  NEW  TO  ROS  _________________________________
I strongly recommend looking over the tutorials for ROS: http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials
You will not technically need to understand ROS or how it works to use hubo_init, but
it is not difficult to learn and will certainly be worthwhile down the road. Regardless,
below I am providing instructions to install and run hubo_init which should be sufficient
whether or not you are familiar with ROS.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
___________________________ PREREQUISITES ______________________________

This package depends on both ROS and hubo-ach.

To obtain hubo-ach, follow the instructions here:
https://github.com/hubo/hubo-ach

To obtain ROS, follow the instructions here (BE SURE TO INSTALL GROOVY):
http://www.ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/Ubuntu

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
_________________Installation (after satisfying the Prerequisites above):____________________

If you do not have a catkin workspace (or you do not know what a catkin workspace is), copy/paste
the following block into a terminal:

mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
catkin_init_workspace
cd ~/catkin_ws/
catkin_make
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc

From now on, the directory ~/catkin_ws/src will be where you keep your ROS package code.


To install hubo_init, copy/paste the following block into a terminal:

cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/hubo/hubo_init.git
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make

____________________________ USAGE ___________________________________
To use hubo_init, do the following:

1) Open a terminal and type in:
    $ roscore
   This will eat up the terminal. Minimize it or move it out of the way.

2) ssh to Hubo's on-board computer and run either
    $ hubo-ach start
   or
    $ sudo service hubo-motion start
   depending on which you intend to use.

   Ignore hubo-console or tech-console (quit out of them or put them aside).
   You will use hubo_init instead.

3) From your workstation (whatever desktop or laptop you use), run
    $ rosrun rviz rviz

4) If this is your first time using hubo_init, do the following:
    a) In the menu bar at the very top, click on 'Panels'
    b) Click on 'Add new panel'
    c) Select HuboInitPanel
    d) Adjust the new panel to whatever size you are comfortable with

5) Make sure the IP Address in the 'Ach Networking' box is correct for your Hubo
    *) If you don't know how to check this, contact mxgrey@gatech.edu
    *) You are encouraged to save RViz after you have the IP Address in.
       Saving RViz also saves the IP Address fields.

6) Click Connect

7) Do whatever.
